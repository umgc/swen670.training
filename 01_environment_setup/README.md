# Lesson 01: Environment Setup

At any company you work for you will be required to spend the first few days setting up your environment. The easiest way to ensure everthing works for you is to have access to a propper bash shell. The easiest way to get one is to just be running linux.

## Requirements

1. Get a propper bash shell.

    * Windows Subsystem for Linux (requires windows professional edditon)
    * Virtual Box (by far the laziest, cheapest, and easiest way to get the latest Ubuntu LTS running on your local)
    * Install linux on a machine you have (More power to you)
    * But I have a mac! (Your terminal will be fine)

## Instructions 

Once you have linux running on your machine somehow:

1. clone this repo onto the machine if it's not present already.
2. Create a branch just like you did for lesson 00, but this time for lesson 01. 
3. On your branch, create a file:
    
    ```
    (last)_(first)_(M.I.).md
    ```

4. In your markdown file, include the folliwing:
    
    * A short summary of how you got bash (if you already had it thats fine)
    * A screen shot of your machine information taken from bash.
    * A screen shot of your bash version taken from bash.
