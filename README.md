# Welcome to SWEN 670

SWEN 670 consists of A comprehensive examination of the tools, skills, and techniques of software engineering and their application. Completion of a major team project is designed to integrate knowledge and skills gained through previous study and provide experience of the constraints commonly experienced in industry (scheduling, vagueness of clients). Project requires forming teams (organization) and scheduling work to meet the deadlines imposed by the contract (syllabus).

In order to be successful in the course, you will be required to utilize every tool they have acquired throughout the course of their post-graduate education at UMGC. In addition to skills you have picked up in the course of your eductation, there will be a handful tools you will have to **master** as well.

As a software engineer, you won't be expected to know everything off the top of your head. However, you will be expected to **acurately gauge how much you do not know** and utilize that knowledge to answer the following questions:

1. What do I need to learn in order to do X?
1. Where should I start?
1. How long will it take me to learn X?

Being a skilled autodidact is essenstial for any career in software construction. Whether you are a manager, a tester, or a developer, you can assume that languages, frameworks, tools and processes will disapear and be replaced. **The only thing preventing you from irrelevance is master the art of acquiring knowledge when you need it**. 

## What is expected of you

This repository is a collection of short, hands-on lessons meant to ensure your success not only in the SWEN 670 course, but also the rest of your career. Each lesson is contained in it's own folder and includes instructions in the README.md within.

**NOTE** The instructions provided are not meant to guide you through what you need to physically do to complete them. The instructions will simply state what is expected of you. **You are required to take the requirements from the instructions research(google) how to do them if you do not already know**.

Interacting with these lessons will take place entirely through **git**. More will be outlined in the first lesson __00_introductions__, but at a basic level you are expected to:

1. clone this repo onto your local machine
2. every time you work on an assignment, you will make a new branch named:    

```
    (lesson number)_(last)_(first)_(M.I)
    
    Example: 00_doe_john_d
```

3. Submissions will take place through a pull request you create on github.
4. You are required to review pull requrests from other students
5. You are required reviews from other students in order to merge
